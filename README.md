# Neap Box

A Vagrant box for [Neap](https://github.com/e7d/neap) development.

## Read me first

This project aims to give you the necessary tools to build yourself the Neap Box.  
**Note:** If you only intend to use the Neap Box, you will never have to build it yourself! Instead, get it from:
* [GitHub releases](https://github.com/e7d/neap-box/releases)
* [Atlas by HashiCorp](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/e7d/boxes/neap-box)

## About

**Version:** 1.4.0-dev  
**Web:** Coming later, [box.neap.io](http://box.neap.io)  
**Project Owner:** MichaÃ«l "[e7d](https://github.com/e7d)" Ferrand

## Prerequisites

In order to build the Neap Box effectively, you'll need to have a few tools installed:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)
2. Install [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org)
3. Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

### Windows-specific ###

1. Add the Git binaries to your path

### Recommended

1. Use a development workstation with at least 2 cores and 8GB of RAM, as Vagrant should be allocated 1GB of RAM
2. Install [Vagrant::VBGuest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest), to manage the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system  
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`

## Build ##

1. `git clone https://github.com/e7d/neap-box.git` to clone the latest version
2. Change into the directory `neap-box`
3. Run `vagrant up`
4. Run `vagrant package --output neap.box`

**Note**: Steps 3. and 4. can be replaced with a call to `build.sh` on bash available environments.

## What you get ##

After the build process is done, you have a file named `neap.box` that can be imported in Vagrant or VirtualBox.

### Software stack ###

Neap box uses Vagrant's [shell provisioner](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/shell.html) over a large collection of scripts to kick things off.
